This repository contains the first peer assignment.

PA1_template.Rmd is the R markdown file which contains the 
Literate Statistical Programming information on how to convert the
activity.csv file and analyze the results.

The R markdown assumes the data file has been downloaded and unzipped.

Files in the directory:
PA1_template.R   - an R script where I worked out all the steps
PA1_template.Rmd - the kniter file
READMR.md        - this file
activity.csv     - the data file
